Introduction
The Excel Bike Sales Analysis project aims to gain insights into bike sales trends by analyzing data related to maritual status, region, and  Education. The goal is to identify patterns, correlations, and opportunities for targeting specific customer segments.

Data Cleanup
The initial step in the project involves data cleanup to ensure data quality and consistency. This includes sorting and filtering the data to remove any irrelevant or duplicate entries. The cleaned dataset will form the foundation for further analysis.

Visualizations with Pivot Tables
To facilitate data analysis and visualization, pivot tables are created in Excel. Pivot tables allow for the aggregation and summarization of data based on various parameters such as age, income, and gender. These pivot tables will provide valuable insights into customer demographics and sales patterns.

Dashboard Creation
Using the cleaned data and pivot tables, a dashboard is created to present the bike sales analysis in a visually appealing and intuitive manner. The dashboard will include charts, graphs, and tables to highlight key findings, trends, and comparisons.
